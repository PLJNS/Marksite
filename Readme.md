Marksite
========

I love Markdown, Bootstrap, and keeping organized directory structures.
Marksite is the intersection of these three things.

Marksite is a dynamic website generator where every Markdown file
is a page, and every directory is both a page and a navigation drop down.
This allows you to create content independent of web development,
organizing it however you find logical. Then, Marksite creates
an interface with the same structure you designed!

## Features

-   Easy by default with Markdown
	-   The navigation bar is defined by directory structure.
	-   The article and table of contents is defined by Markdown.
	-   The footer is defined by a Markdown list.
-   Beautiful by default with Bootstrap
-   Compatible by default with Boilerplate

## Quick start

1.  Download the source
2.  Load it on your server
3.  Define your metadata in `/php/header.php`
4.  Define your index in `/pages/index.md`
5.  Define your footer in `/pages/footer.md`
6.  Add any other Markdown files to `/pages/`
7.  You're done!
