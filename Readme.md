# Marksite

I find writing HTML tedious.

I like writing notes, however, and I believe in free and open courseware.

This is my lightweight CMS to publish notes. Check out <a href = "http://www.eden.rutgers.edu/~pmj34">my site</a>.

## Features

- No HTML. Ever.
	+ Dynamic content from Markdown files
	+ Builds a navbar based on directory structure
	+ Generates table of contents based on header structure and Tocify
- Beautiful by default with Bootstrap
- Compatible by default with Boilerplate

## Quick start

- Download the source
- Load it on your server
- Add Markdown files to `/pages`
- Go to `php/header.php` and add your own values for metadata
